            <h2>Phyisics Informed Neural Network to Solve the 1-D Burgers Equation</h2>
            <ul>
                <p>This is 1 dimensional burgers equation solution shown before and after training that was solved using automatic differentiation in PyTorch as a physics informed neural network. 
                    The way it works is that given the inputs to a PDE, the backpropagation allows the network to learn the solution to the PDE based on the conservation constraint given by the physics informed loss (usually just the PDE expressed as a homogenous equation), alongside the data driven loss. 
                    This problem only accepts fixed grids, which is an artifact of using a neural network. Currently I am working on methods such as physics informed neural operators which allow grids of any size within a margin by using the fourier transform. Other methods to deal with mesh-like inputs that have any tensor length are common in graph neural networks, which I have researched considerably at Atomic Industries. Top image represents domain initialization, bottom is after learning the PDE. </p>
